Here is a Ghost stack built with docker-compose. This stack is built with the tutum/haproxy, a mariaDB database, a storage container to store images & themes, and of course the Ghost CMS.

This is not an out of the box soultion and does require some manipulation of the config.js file indicating your hostname and local directory paths.

### Installation
